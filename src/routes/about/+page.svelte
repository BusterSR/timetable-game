    <h1>About this game</h1>
    <p>I (<a href="https://vulcanwm.is-a.dev" target="_blank">VulcanWM</a>) made this project with <bold>Svelte</bold> and <bold>SvelteKit</bold>.</p>
    <p>Since I first played <a href="https://ttrockstars.com/" target="_blank">TTRockstars</a>, I've always wanted to make a game like this.</p>
    <p>So when I started learning Svelte and needed a project idea, I decided to make this.</p>
    <p>Check out its <a href="https://github.com/VulcanWM/timetable-game" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a> if you're curious about how it was made.</p>
